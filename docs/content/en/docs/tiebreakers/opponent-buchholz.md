description: "Buchholz variants that handle incomplete rounds or average opponent contributions."
---

These two tiebreakers extend the [Buchholz](../buchholz/) concept for specific situations: Fore Buchholz handles tournaments with an incomplete final round, and Average Opponent Buchholz normalizes Buchholz values across opponents.

Both belong to **FIDE Category C** (based on opponents' results, advanced variants).

## Forfeit handling

Both tiebreakers use `buildOpponentData()`, which excludes all forfeits from game entries. Only OTB results (`ResultWhiteWins`, `ResultBlackWins`, `ResultDraw`) produce game entries. Virtual opponents (for byes and absences) use the player's own score, following the same convention as the [Buchholz family](../buchholz/).

## Tiebreakers

### fore-buchholz

**ID:** `fore-buchholz`
**Name:** Fore Buchholz
**FIDE Category:** C

Fore Buchholz computes the full Buchholz score as if all pending final-round games ended in draws. This allows standings to be computed before the last round is complete. If all games in the final round are already finished, Fore Buchholz equals regular Buchholz.

**Algorithm:**

1. Start with actual scores for all players.
2. Identify pending games in the last round (`ResultPending` in `state.Rounds[last]`).
3. For each pending game, add +0.5 to both the White and Black player's virtual score.
4. Build opponent data via `buildOpponentData()` (which skips pending games).
5. For each pending final-round game, manually inject virtual game entries as draws into both players' game lists, and decrement their absence counts (since `buildOpponentData()` counted them as absent for that round).
6. Override the score map with the virtual scores from step 3.
7. Compute full Buchholz using `opponentScores()` (the same function used by the [Buchholz family](../buchholz/)): collect all opponent scores (real + virtual opponents for byes/absences), sum them.

**Formula:** `Buchholz(modified state where pending last-round games = draws)`

**Special handling:**

- Only the final round's pending games are treated as draws. Pending games in earlier rounds (if any) remain excluded.
- The virtual score adjustment (+0.5 per pending game) propagates through opponent score lookups, affecting all players whose opponents have pending games.
- If no rounds exist, all values are 0.

### avg-opponent-buchholz

**ID:** `avg-opponent-buchholz`
**Name:** Avg Opponent Buchholz (AOB)
**FIDE Category:** C

Average Opponent Buchholz first computes the full Buchholz for every player, then for each player averages the Buchholz values of their OTB opponents. This normalizes the tiebreaker across players who may have played different numbers of games.

**Algorithm:**

1. Compute full Buchholz for every scored player using `opponentScores()`:
   - Collect real opponent scores from OTB games.
   - Add virtual opponent scores (player's own score) for byes and absences.
   - Sum all opponent scores.
2. For each player, iterate their OTB game entries:
   - Sum the Buchholz values of each opponent.
   - Divide by the number of OTB games.

If the player has no OTB games, the value is 0.

**Formula:** `SUM(opponent Buchholz values) / number of OTB games`

## Usage

```go
import (
    "context"

    "github.com/zyzniewski/chesspairing"
    "github.com/zyzniewski/chesspairing/tiebreaker"
)

// Fore Buchholz (handles pending final-round games)
tb, err := tiebreaker.Get("fore-buchholz")
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
values, err := tb.Compute(ctx, state, scores)

// Average Opponent Buchholz
tb, err = tiebreaker.Get("avg-opponent-buchholz")
values, err = tb.Compute(ctx, state, scores)
```

Each call returns a `[]chesspairing.TieBreakValue` with one entry per player.
