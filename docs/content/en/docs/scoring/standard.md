---

Standard scoring assigns a fixed number of points for each game outcome: 1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, 0 for a loss. Every point value is configurable, but the default values follow FIDE conventions used in virtually all rated Swiss and round-robin events.

Because points depend only on the result -- not on the opponent -- standard scoring requires no iteration and produces deterministic standings after a single pass through the results.

## When to use

Standard scoring is the right choice for most tournaments:

- **FIDE-rated events.** Required by FIDE regulations for all officially rated competitions.
- **Swiss and round-robin tournaments.** The expected scoring system for these formats.
- **Any event where simplicity matters.** Points are easy to explain and verify: a win is always worth the same, regardless of who you beat.

Even when a tournament uses a different public scoring system (like Keizer), the Swiss pairers use standard scoring internally to form score groups.

## Configuration

### CLI

Pass scoring options through the TRF `XXY` field or via `--config`:

```bash
chesspairing pair --config '{"scoring": {"pointWin": 1.0, "pointDraw": 0.5, "pointBye": 0.5}}' tournament.trf
```

### Go API

```go
import "github.com/zyzniewski/chesspairing/scoring/standard"

// With explicit options (nil fields use defaults).
scorer := standard.New(standard.Options{
    PointBye: chesspairing.Float64Ptr(0.5),
})

// From a generic map (e.g. parsed from JSON config).
scorer := standard.NewFromMap(map[string]any{
    "pointBye": 0.5,
})

// Use the Scorer interface.
scores, err := scorer.Score(ctx, &state)
points := scorer.PointsForResult(result, rctx)
```

The `Scorer` type satisfies the `chesspairing.Scorer` interface at compile time:

```go
var _ chesspairing.Scorer = (*standard.Scorer)(nil)
```

### Options reference

All fields are `*float64`. A `nil` value means "use the default." This distinguishes "not configured" from "explicitly set to zero."

| Field                 | JSON key              | Default | Description                                                  |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `PointWin`            | `pointWin`            | 1.0     | Points for an over-the-board win.                            |
| `PointDraw`           | `pointDraw`           | 0.5     | Points for a draw. Also used for `ByeHalf`.                  |
| `PointLoss`           | `pointLoss`           | 0.0     | Points for a loss. Also used for `ByeZero`.                  |
| `PointBye`            | `pointBye`            | 1.0     | Points for a pairing-allocated bye (`ByePAB`).               |
| `PointForfeitWin`     | `pointForfeitWin`     | 1.0     | Points for winning by forfeit.                               |
| `PointForfeitLoss`    | `pointForfeitLoss`    | 0.0     | Points for losing by forfeit.                                |
| `PointAbsent`         | `pointAbsent`         | 0.0     | Points for an unexcused absence (`ByeAbsent`, or no game and no bye). |
| `PointExcused`        | `pointExcused`        | 0.0     | Points for an excused absence (`ByeExcused`).                |
| `PointClubCommitment` | `pointClubCommitment` | 0.0     | Points for a club-commitment absence (`ByeClubCommitment`).  |

## How it works

### Score()

The `Score()` method makes a single pass through all rounds to accumulate points:

1. **Initialize.** Create a zero score for every active player.

2. **Process each round.** For every round in the tournament:
   - **Games.** Each game is scored according to its result:
     - _Double forfeit_ -- both players receive 0 (the game is treated as if it never happened).
     - _Single forfeit_ -- the winner receives `PointForfeitWin`, the loser receives `PointForfeitLoss`.
     - _Regular result_ -- `PointWin`/`PointDraw`/`PointLoss` as appropriate. Pending games (`*`) contribute nothing.

   - **Byes.** Each bye is scored by type:
     - `ByePAB` -- `PointBye`
     - `ByeHalf` -- `PointDraw`
     - `ByeZero` -- `PointLoss`
     - `ByeAbsent` -- `PointAbsent`
     - `ByeExcused` -- `PointExcused`
     - `ByeClubCommitment` -- `PointClubCommitment`

   - **Absent detection.** Any active player who neither played a game nor received a bye in the round is treated as absent and receives `PointAbsent`.

3. **Rank.** Players are sorted by score descending, then by rating descending, then by display name ascending.

### PointsForResult()

Returns the point value for a single result. The method dispatches in this order:

1. If `rctx.ByeType` is non-nil -- return the matching `PointBye` / `PointDraw` / `PointLoss` / `PointAbsent` / `PointExcused` / `PointClubCommitment`.
2. Else if `result.IsForfeit()` -- return `PointForfeitWin` for a forfeit win, otherwise `PointForfeitLoss`.
3. Else for a regular game -- return `PointWin`, `PointDraw`, or `0` (loss / pending).

The `ByeType` pointer takes precedence: a played game's `Result` is ignored when the entry is a bye.

## Examples

### Default FIDE scoring

```go
scorer := standard.New(standard.Options{})
scores, _ := scorer.Score(ctx, &state)
// Player who won 3, drew 1, lost 1: 3×1.0 + 1×0.5 + 1×0.0 = 3.5
```

### Half-point PAB

Some organisers prefer a half-point bye instead of a full point:

```go
scorer := standard.New(standard.Options{
    PointBye: chesspairing.Float64Ptr(0.5),
})
```

### Penalizing absences

Award a negative score for unexcused absences:

```go
scorer := standard.New(standard.Options{
    PointAbsent: chesspairing.Float64Ptr(-1.0),
})
```
