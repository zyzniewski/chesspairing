---

Keizer scoring is a ranking-based system popular in club tournaments in Belgium and the Netherlands. The central idea: beating a strong opponent earns more points than beating a weak one. Each player is assigned a value number based on their current rank, and game points are computed as fractions of the opponent's value number. Because value numbers depend on rankings, and rankings depend on scores, the system must iterate until it converges.

The engine uses x2 integer arithmetic internally to eliminate floating-point drift while preserving half-point granularity. Convergence typically happens within 3-5 iterations, with a hard cap at 20 and oscillation detection to guarantee termination.

## When to use

- **Club internal competitions.** Keizer is designed for long-running club leagues where players may miss rounds regularly. The absence-handling system (fractions, limits, decay, club commitments) is far richer than standard scoring.
- **Tournaments where opponent strength should matter.** In standard scoring, a win is always worth 1 point regardless of the opponent. In Keizer, beating the top-ranked player earns significantly more than beating the bottom-ranked player.
- **Combined pairing and scoring.** The Keizer pairer uses the Keizer scorer internally to rank players before pairing, creating a tightly integrated system. However, the scorer can also be used independently with any pairing system.

Keizer scoring is not suitable for FIDE-rated events, which require standard 1-half-0 scoring.

## Configuration

### CLI

Pass Keizer scoring options through the TRF `XXY` field or via `--config`:

```bash
chesspairing pair --config '{"scoring": {"winFraction": 1.0, "drawFraction": 0.5, "selfVictory": true}}' tournament.trf
```

### Go API

```go
import "github.com/zyzniewski/chesspairing/scoring/keizer"

// With explicit options (nil fields use defaults).
scorer := keizer.New(keizer.Options{
    LossFraction: chesspairing.Float64Ptr(1.0 / 6.0),
    AbsenceLimit: chesspairing.IntPtr(0),
})

// From a generic map (e.g. parsed from JSON config).
scorer := keizer.NewFromMap(map[string]any{
    "lossFraction": 1.0 / 6.0,
    "absenceLimit": 0,
})

// Use the Scorer interface.
scores, err := scorer.Score(ctx, &state)
points := scorer.PointsForResult(result, rctx)
```

The `Scorer` type satisfies the `chesspairing.Scorer` interface at compile time:

```go
var _ chesspairing.Scorer = (*keizer.Scorer)(nil)
```

### Options reference

Options are organized in five groups. All pointer fields use `nil` to mean "use the default."

#### Value numbers

These control how value numbers are assigned from rankings. The player at rank _r_ gets: `ValueNumberBase - (r-1) * ValueNumberStep`.

| ------------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `ByeValueFraction`       | `*float64` | `byeValueFraction`       | 0.50    | Fraction for a pairing-allocated bye (PAB).      |

| `ClubCommitmentFraction` | `*float64` | `clubCommitmentFraction` | 0.70    | Fraction for absence due to interclub team duty. |

#### Fixed-value overrides

When set (non-nil), these replace the corresponding fraction calculation with a fixed score. Values are in real units (not x2). Leave `nil` to use the fraction-based calculation.

| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SelfVictory`      | `*bool`    | `selfVictory`      | true    | Add each player's own value number to their total (once, not per round).                                                                                      |

## How it works

### Score()

Keizer scoring is iterative because it has a circular dependency: scores depend on value numbers, value numbers depend on rankings, and rankings depend on scores. The algorithm resolves this through repeated recalculation:

1. **Initial ranking.** Rank all active players by rating descending, then by display name ascending.

2. **Iterate** (up to 20 times):

   a. **Reset scores.** Clear all x2 scores to zero.

   b. **Compute value numbers.** From the current ranking, assign each player a value number: `ValueNumberBase - (rank-1) * ValueNumberStep`. The top-ranked player gets the highest value.

   c. **Score all rounds.** For each round, process games, byes, absences, and late-join rounds:
   - _Games:_ points = `round(opponent_value * fraction * 2)` using x2 integer arithmetic. For example, a win against a player with value 20 at WinFraction=1.0 yields `20 * 1.0 * 2 = 40` in x2 units.
   - _Byes:_ points = `round(own_value * fraction * 2)`, or `fixed_value * 2` when a fixed-value override is set. Club commitments are exempt from the absence limit and decay.
   - _Absences:_ same as byes using `AbsentPenaltyFraction` or `AbsentFixedValue`, subject to the absence limit and decay. Excused absences count toward the limit; club commitments do not.
   - _Late-join rounds:_ for players with `JoinedRound > 1`, rounds before the join round score `LateJoinHandicap` as a flat value instead of going through the absence calculation. These rounds do not count toward the absence limit and are not affected by decay.

   d. **Self-victory.** If enabled, add `own_value * 2` to each player's x2 total (once, not per round).

   e. **Re-rank.** Sort players by x2 score descending, rating descending, display name ascending.

   f. **Check convergence.** If the ranking is unchanged from the previous iteration, stop.

   g. **Check for oscillation.** If the ranking matches the one from two iterations ago (a 2-cycle), average the x2 scores from the last two iterations, re-rank, and stop. This handles cases where two players with very similar scores keep swapping positions.

3. **Convert to real scores.** Divide all x2 scores by 2 to produce the final values.

### Frozen mode

When `Frozen` is set to `true`, the iterative loop is replaced by a sequential pass through the rounds. Each round is scored once using the ranking as it stood before that round, and the ranking is updated afterward. Earlier rounds are never rescored when later results shift the standings.

The sequence:

1. Start with the initial rating-based ranking.
2. For each round in order, compute value numbers from the current ranking, score games/byes/absences for that round, and re-rank.
3. After all rounds, add self-victory (if enabled) using the final ranking.

This produces different results from the standard iterative mode. In standard mode, all rounds are rescored retroactively with the converged ranking, so a player's round-1 win is worth the opponent's final value number. In frozen mode, that same win is worth the opponent's value number at the time -- which may have been higher or lower before later rounds shifted things around.

Frozen mode is useful for clubs that want scores to reflect the standings as they developed over the season, rather than retroactively rewriting history from the endpoint.

### Why x2 integer arithmetic

Keizer scores are sums of products of integers and fractions. Repeated floating-point addition would accumulate rounding errors that could affect rankings. The x2 approach works in doubled integers throughout (so 0.5 real points = 1 in x2 units), which eliminates drift while still supporting half-point resolution. The conversion to real numbers happens only at the final output step.

### Absence rules

- **Absence limit.** After `AbsenceLimit` absences, all further absences score 0. This prevents players who barely participate from accumulating meaningful scores.
- **Absence decay.** When enabled, each successive absence earns half the previous one: 1st = full fraction, 2nd = fraction/2, 3rd = fraction/4, and so on (implemented as a right bit-shift on the x2 value).
- **Club commitments** are always exempt from both the limit and the decay. A player who misses rounds for interclub team duty is not penalized the way a regular absence would be.
- **Excused absences** receive their own fraction (`ExcusedAbsentFraction`) but do count toward the absence limit and decay.
- **Late joiners.** When a player has `JoinedRound > 1`, rounds before the join round are scored using `LateJoinHandicap` as a fixed value rather than the normal absence logic. These pre-join rounds bypass the absence limit and decay entirely, so a late joiner's actual absences (after joining) are counted from zero.

## Variant presets

Several well-known Keizer variants can be configured by setting specific options:

| Variant               | Key differences from defaults                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **KeizerForClubs**    | All defaults. The most widely used variant.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Classic KNSB**      | `ByeValueFraction`=4/6, `AbsentPenaltyFraction`=2/6, `ClubCommitmentFraction`=2/3, `ExcusedAbsentFraction`=2/6, `AbsenceLimit`=5. Based on the traditional Dutch chess federation system. |
| **FreeKeizer**        | `LossFraction`=1/6, `ByeValueFraction`=4/6, `AbsentPenaltyFraction`=2/6, `AbsenceLimit`=5. Adds a "toughness bonus" where losses against strong opponents earn a small reward.            |
| **No self-victory**   | `SelfVictory`=false. Removes the bonus for participation.                                                                                                                                 |
| **Fixed absences**    | `AbsentFixedValue`=15, `ExcusedAbsentFixedValue`=15, `ClubCommitmentFixedValue`=25. Uses absolute values instead of fractions.                                                            |
| **Decaying absences** | `AbsenceDecay`=true, `AbsenceLimit`=0. Each absence earns less than the previous one, with no hard cap.                                                                                   |

## Examples

### Default KeizerForClubs

```go
scorer := keizer.New(keizer.Options{})
scores, _ := scorer.Score(ctx, &state)
```

With 10 players, the top-ranked player has value number 10. If that player beats the 3rd-ranked player (value 8): points = 8 _ 1.0 = 8.0. If they draw: 8 _ 0.5 = 4.0. Self-victory adds their own value (10) once.

### FreeKeizer with toughness bonus

```go
scorer := keizer.New(keizer.Options{
    LossFraction:          chesspairing.Float64Ptr(1.0 / 6.0),
    ByeValueFraction:      chesspairing.Float64Ptr(4.0 / 6.0),
    AbsentPenaltyFraction: chesspairing.Float64Ptr(2.0 / 6.0),
    AbsenceLimit:          chesspairing.IntPtr(5),
})
```

Losing to the top player (value 10) now earns 10 \* 1/6 = 1.5 points (rounded to x2 grid) instead of 0.

### Fixed absence values

```go
scorer := keizer.New(keizer.Options{
    AbsentFixedValue:         chesspairing.IntPtr(15),
    ExcusedAbsentFixedValue:  chesspairing.IntPtr(15),
    ClubCommitmentFixedValue: chesspairing.IntPtr(25),
})
```

All players receive the same fixed score for absences, regardless of their rank.
